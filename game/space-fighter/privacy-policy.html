        <h2>Privacy Policy for Space Fighter</h2>

        <p>Effective date: August 30, 2025</p>

        <p>Space Fighter ("we", "our", or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information, comply with applicable laws, and ensure transparency with our users.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <p>Space Fighter does not directly collect any personal information from users. The App may, however, include features provided by third-party services that may collect certain information automatically:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google In-App Purchases:</strong> May collect information necessary to process transactions, such as billing details and device information.</li>
            <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> May collect non-personal information, including device identifiers, usage data, and interactions with ads.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use of Information</h2>

        <p>We do not use personal information ourselves. Any information collected by third-party services is used solely for their own purposes, such as processing payments or delivering personalized ads, according to their own privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>The App integrates third-party services as listed previously</p>

        <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>

        <p>Our App is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:allconade@gmail.com">allconade@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>

        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect any information processed by the App or by third-party services. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page, and the updated effective date will be indicated. We encourage users to review this policy periodically.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
